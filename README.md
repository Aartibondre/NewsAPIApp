<h1 style="color:blue;">Creating News API App For Fetching Top News</h1>
<p> The project is made using HTML, some CSS and JS using only one file index.html. The aim of this project is to fetch the top news of the world using keywords, fetching and retreiving news from the api.
It includes Navbar and buttons and home tab, search bar. Dropdown menu and retreiving through clicking on a type of news is under development in this project.</p>

<h2 style="color:red;"> Pre Requisites Of The Project</h2>
<p> We need VS code for opening this project.
API Key from NEWS API.
LIVE Server installed in VS code for going live in the project. You can install this from VS Code extensions. Just install it and restart VS code and it's done.
If you want to host the project you cannot do from NEWS API since it requires LICENSE for production, but you can use GitHub or Linode to host as a localhost.</p>

<h2 style="color:red;">Steps To Run The Project </h2>
<p>First of all, go to https://newsapi.org, create an account providing your details and password. You will be provided with an API Key> this KEY is unique for each user. So, you must create 
your own API key, since I will change my API key.
Clone this project in your system and open in VS Code.
Copy your API key from your NEWS API account and paste it in the index.html file. In this way your server will get connected.
You need to install Live Server from VS Code Extensions and Restart your VS Code after which you will find Go Live button at the right hand side to the screen.
If it directly works then its great, if not watch YT videos to resolve your issue or you can also try to enter the Local lost URL manually and check. 
In my case it was "127.0.0.1:5500/index.html". You can change it according to the requirement.
And your NEWS API is ready for deployment.
I have just created a simple example for demo.You can add many more HTML and CSS to the same.
