This file contains about what is basically done in this project.

The file index.html contains everything- HTML, CSS, JS.
I have used bootstrap for designing the homepage.
I have installed live server for the api.
I have specifically used Navbar and Card from the bootstrap documentation.

CSS basics for changing color, size, image and anything else needed.


JS:
Firstly, I have used NEWS API here which requires License for production, so I have used a free version available for development.
https://newsapi.org/ - get your api key from here. Just replace your api key in the index.html file 
You have to create your own account on the above website and get your API Key. Do not use my key as I will definitely change it for privacy.
Make a function to access news using fetchNews() and use fetch api.
Include language and apikey.
I have used addEventListener for onclick button.
Then convert output to JSON().
Access the response and create divs to display news using for of loop.
As the deployment is paid, we cannot use News api but we can deploy it on localhost using LINODE or any other cloud technology.
